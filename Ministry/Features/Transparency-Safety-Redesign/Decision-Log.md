# Decision Log — Transparency & Safety Redesign

Append-only, workstream-local, per `CLAUDE.md`. One entry per PR merged
and per ruling made. Never edit or renumber a past entry; a correction is
a new entry that says what it corrects.

**Entry 1 — 2026-09-19.** Workstream opened. Fable design pass 2
(Opus-reconciliation) complete: `Adjusted-Design.md`, `Build-Plan.md`,
`Rulings-Pending.md` written from the Fable agent's report. Reviewable
summary published as an Artifact:
`https://claude.ai/artifact/N8jiwbkB7kqsdH1jiq8622`. Mark authorized
starting the Sonnet build thread on Stages 0–4 only; Stages 5–9 remain
blocked on `Rulings-Pending.md` and Stage 1's own measurement.

**Entry 2 — 2026-09-19.** Prior to this workstream, three live safety
defects found by an independent Opus adversarial review were fixed and
merged to `main` (PR #306, commit `1c522e918`): a reader-timeout
discarding a successful crisis classification (`engine/m5/failure.py`,
`engine/m5/routing.py`); the crisis-continuation message carrying no
actual redirect language (`engine/m4/crisis_resources.py`); the
citation-grounding check being fooled by a fabricated claim built from a
forbidding guard's own vocabulary — partial fix only
(`engine/prose.py`); the full defect is structural and is what
`Build-Plan.md` Stage 1 measures. Noted here for this workstream's own
record since it is the ground truth `Adjusted-Design.md` §0 stands on.
